# Goodreads Book Recommender System Documentation
This documentation covers the setup, functionality, and execution steps of the Goodreads Book Recommender System. This system searches for a specific book on Goodreads, retrieves its details, and then recommends five books based on similarities in content and ratings from the Goodreads Best Awards selections.

## System Overview

The system combines web scraping, text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and cosine similarity to find and recommend books. It operates in several steps:

Web Scraping: Uses Selenium to navigate Goodreads, search for a book, and scrape its average rating and summary.

Text Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses book summaries to facilitate similarity comparisons.

TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts preprocessed text summaries into a vectorized form to quantify content similarity.

Recommendation Algorithm: Combines cosine similarity based on book summaries and average ratings to recommend books.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+

- Selenium

- Scikit-learn

- Pandas

- Numpy

Ensure you have a Chrome WebDriver installed and accessible in your system's PATH or specify the path explicitly in the script.

## Setup

### Installation

Install the required Python packages using pip:
Copy code
```bash
pip install selenium scikit-learn pandas numpy
```
### Environment Variables

Set the CHROME_DRIVER_PATH environment variable to the path of your Chrome WebDriver if it's not in your system's PATH.

### Dataset

The system requires a dataset named goodreads_books.csv with at least the following columns: title, author, summary, and average_rate. Ensure this file is located in the same directory as the script or modify the script to point to the correct location.

### Components

Preprocess Text
A function to clean and preprocess text data, making it suitable for vectorization.

### GoodreadsScraper

A class to handle web scraping on Goodreads using Selenium. It searches for a book, handles pop-ups, and extracts book details.

### RecommendationSystem
A class that takes the dataset, initializes TF-IDF vectorization, and implements the logic to recommend books based on content similarity and ratings.

## Execution Flow

- Initialization: The user inputs a book title to search for.

- Data Preparation: The script reads the dataset, preprocesses text summaries, and prepares the TF-IDF matrix.

- Web Scraping: The script uses the GoodreadsScraper to find the book on Goodreads and retrieve its details.

- Recommendation: The RecommendationSystem uses the book's details to find and recommend similar books from the dataset.

## Usage

Run the script from the command line or an IDE. When prompted, enter the title of the book you're interested in. The system will then output five recommended books based on your input.

## Customization

You can customize the recommendation logic by adjusting the weights for content similarity and rating influence in the get_recommendations method of the RecommendationSystem class.

## Limitations and Considerations

The system's efficiency and scalability might be limited by the use of Selenium for web scraping.
Ensure compliance with Goodreads' terms of service and robots.txt when scraping.
The recommendation quality depends on the dataset's completeness and the chosen weights for similarity and ratings.

## Conclusion

This Goodreads Book Recommender System offers a practical approach to finding and recommending books based on user interests. By leveraging web scraping, text processing, and machine learning techniques, it provides a foundation for developing sophisticated book recommendation systems.
